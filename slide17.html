        <ul>
            <li>This does not mean that frameworks and libraries are bad. I picked on React a lot even though I still like it despite these feeling I have that it may be the wrong direction.</li>
            <li>Make sure you have a good reason to use them. Understand the problem they were built to solve. You likely don't have that same exact problem. Use them sparringly.</li>
            <li>Skew towards the most simple way to accomplish a task. Keep the easy stuff easy.</li>
