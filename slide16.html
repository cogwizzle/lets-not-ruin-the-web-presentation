        <b>I've had multiple conversations where:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>A more junior engineer only knows a single framework.</li>
            <li>
                A peer was not aware of the built in functionality of the web.
                I didn't teach them.
            </li>
            <li>
                I pushed customers into overly complex solutions because it was
                my prefered way to work.
            </li>
            <li>
                I encouraged solving the problem at hand rather than
                creating understanding about the web in general. Deadlines were
                the most important thing.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We have a moral responsibility to keep the web accessible and to
            keep the web simple. We need to teach the next generation of the
            platform. We need to teach them why the abstractions exist and how
            we got there. We need to help them fail faster than we have so they
            don't spend years making the same mistakes we have.
