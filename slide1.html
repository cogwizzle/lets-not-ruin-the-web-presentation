        <h1>Today</h1>
        <p>
            The web has evolved to be way larger than what its intended use
            case. Engineers are driving towards complexity at extreme cost.

            The point of this talk is not to talk down at my peers about their
            technology choices. The point is to bring awareness to some real
            problems we've created in the last 10 years. I want to talk about
            our responsibility as creators to guide the web to a better place.
