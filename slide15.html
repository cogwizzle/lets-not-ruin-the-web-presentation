        <h1>Who is to Blame?</h1>
        <b>Me.</b>
        Why?
        <ul>
            <li>
                I got too excited about the promise of reusable components.
            </li>
            <li>I chased ever shiny framework under the sun.</li>
            <li>
                It took me 10 years of framework chasing to ask is this getting
                easier? It wasn't. Building websites and web apps was harder
                than ever.
            </li>
            <li>
                Single Page Apps provided a superior navigation experience. At
                the expense of replicating browser navigation and breaking
                native browser behavior.
            </li>
            <li>
                I became enamored with JavaScript's evolution and being good at
                JavaScript became a badge of honor. Its still my favorite
                language.
            </li>
